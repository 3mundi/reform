* `validates :title, :presence => true`
  with @model.title == "Little Green Car" and validate({}) the form is still valid (as we "have" a valid title). is that what we want?

* document Form#to_hash and Form#to_nested_hash (e.g. with OpenStruct composition to make it a very simple form)
* document getter: and representer_exec:

* allow :as to rename nested forms

vererben in inline representern (module zum einmixen, attrs l√∂schen)

# TODO: remove the concept of Errors#messages and just iterate over Errors.
# each form contains its local field errors in Errors
# form.messages should then go through them and compile a "summary" instead of adding them to the parents #errors in #validate.
